## History

I have been writing Markdown in source code comments for many years.  I have
found it especially useful for documenting SQL schema definitions!  The
database design can be very enlightening when learning about a complex system,
so I think it is worthwhile to document it well.  It is also beneficial to
document the intended purposes of indexes and optimizations, as well as
intentional limitations of a database design.

Since parsing line-based comments is so simple, I have often just used `sed`
to do so.  The implementation is generally so short that it can easily fit in
a `Makefile`.  I decided to go ahead and write a program for the task,
however, in order to have a simple utility that supports features that I
usually skip when using `sed` for a wide variety of source languages.  I also
wanted to have an easy way to author blog entries and articles using literate
source code on [my website](https://www.extrema.is).

## Design Goals

I am trying to keep the implementation simple.  I considered adding support
for multi-line comments but think that the simplicity of only supporting line
comments is worthwhile.

The initial implementation supports two "flavors" of Markdown, but I use
module and option names ("target formats") that allow for the addition of
non-Markdown target formats in the future.  I only plan on supporting Markdown
at this time, however.

## Implementation

The initial prototype utilized lazy evaluation, through lazy `Text` and lists.
It was very easy to understand and was aligned with my goal of simplicity.  I
have run into memory/performance issues with such implementations in other
projects, however, so I decided to use [conduit][], a streaming library that
manages resources well.

Performance of decoding and encoding of UTF-8 in Haskell varies according to
the data types used.  I wrote some blog articles about some benchmarks that I
experimented with during the implementation of LiterateX:

* [Decoding UTF-8 in Haskell](https://www.extrema.is/blog/2021/05/10/decoding-utf8-in-haskell)
* [Decoding UTF-8 in Haskell (Part 2)](https://www.extrema.is/blog/2021/05/11/decoding-utf8-in-haskell-part-2)
* [Encoding UTF-8 in Haskell](https://www.extrema.is/blog/2021/05/14/encoding-utf8-in-haskell)

I implemented a number of different APIs in an attempt to create an API that
is simple yet does not limit users with respect to performance.  I ended up
providing a high-level API that does not expose use of `conduit` as well as a
low-level API that does.  Since the low-level API provides ways to process
many "textual" types, the high-level API could be kept simple.

In the implementation of the tests, source format tests are high-level: they
test example source code for each supported source format, not the
implementation.  While this results in repetition, I think it is worthwhile.
